select Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths,

order by 1,2

--now, we are looking at the total cases VS the population
--it will show us what percentage of population got covid in US

--but wait, there is something wrong .. lets check total_deaths 
--total_deaths is varchar so we to have change to int. 
--looks better, but instead of int we should use bigint such as this kind of dataset has many datas 
--int use 2^32, bigint uses 2^64
--there is still something wrong. check out the location.asia is not a country neither is world, add query where continent is not null everywhere.

--show continents with the highest death count per population

select continent, MAX(CAST(total_deaths as bigint)) as Total_Death_Count

where continent is not null
group by continent
order by Total_Death_Count desc

--lets check all new cases by date.

select date, SUM(new_cases) as New_Cases, SUM(CAST(new_deaths as bigint)) as New_Deaths
from CovidDeaths
where continent is not null
group by date
order by 1,2

--lets do percentage of new deaths based on new cases.

select date, SUM(new_cases) as New_Cases, SUM(CAST(new_deaths as bigint)) as New_Deaths,

--so we see that after vaccinations death percentages getting lower even cases getting even more than before
-- feburary 20,24,22 in 2020 recorded the highest death percentages..


--lets see total population and new vaccination by date. using joins

select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date,vac.new_vaccinations as New_Vaccinations

on dea.location = vac.location and dea.date = vac.date -- here connecting 2 tables with 2 keys, namely location and date
where dea.continent is not null
order by 2,3


-- this is for new vaccinations per day and i want to see for total vaccinations per day

where dea.continent is not null
order by 2,3

-- now after new vaccinations total vac = new vacc + new day vac.

-- i want to see percentage of new vaccby population 
-- i will create CTE for that 

--1st way with CTE
